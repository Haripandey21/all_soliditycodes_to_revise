You can send Ether to other contracts by

**   transfer (2300 gas, throws error)
**   send (2300 gas, returns bool)
**   call (forward all gas or set gas, returns bool)
How to receive Ether?
A contract receiving Ether must have at least one of the functions below :
          receive() external payable
          fallback() external payable

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Error {
    function testRequire(uint _i) public pure {
        // Require should be used to validate conditions such as:
        // - inputs
        // - conditions before execution
        // - return values from calls to other functions
        require(_i > 10, "Input must be greater than 10");
    }

    function testRevert(uint _i) public pure {
        // Revert is useful when the condition to check is complex.
        // This code does the exact same thing as the example above
        if (_i <= 10) {
            revert("Input must be greater than 10");
        }
    }

    uint public num;

    function testAssert() public view {
        // Assert should only be used to test for internal errors,
        // and to check invariants.

        // Here we assert that num is always equal to 0
        // since it is impossible to update the value of num
        assert(num == 0);
    }

    // custom error
    error InsufficientBalance(uint balance, uint withdrawAmount);

    function testCustomError(uint _withdrawAmount) public view {
        uint bal = address(this).balance;
        if (bal < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({balance: bal, withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount});
        }
    }
}
